# Modeling of Urban Fires

----

## _ABSTRACT_

In this presentation we discuss the modeling and simulation of urban fires.

First, we briefly examine the problem domain: 
- What are the "ingredients" of a large urban fire?
- What are the components of an urban firefighting system?

Second, we outline a few methodologies for modeling of urban fires.

Then we present two System Dynamics models: one for the actual, physical propagation of fires,
the other for macro-scale long term firefighting. 

Finally, we examine in more detail simulations with those models and discuss their calibration.
(Using "real life" data.)

The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to the modeling process is also discussed.
