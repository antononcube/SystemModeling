# Investigating COVID-19 with R: data analysis and simulations 
**Methodological presentation**   
[R-Ladies Miami Meetup, May 28th 2020](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-miami/events/270611412/)   

The 
[extended abstract of the presentation](https://github.com/antononcube/SystemModeling/blob/master/Presentations/R-Ladies-Miami-Meetup-May-2020/ExtendedAbstract.md)
was loosely followed. 
Here is the presentation mind-map:

(Note that mind-map's PDF has hyperlinks. Also, see the folder 
[Presentation-aids](https://github.com/antononcube/SystemModeling/tree/master/Presentations/R-Ladies-Miami-Meetup-May-2020/Presentaion-aids).
)

The organizers and I did 
[a poll for what people want to hear](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antononcube/SystemModeling/master/Presentations/R-Ladies-Miami-Meetup-May-2020/Presentaion-aids/R-Ladies-Meetup-2020-05-28-poll.png).
After discussing the results of the 15 votes from that poll we decided the presentation to be a methodological one 
instead of a know-how one.

Approximately 30% of the presentation was based on the R-project 
["COVID-19-modeling-in-R"](https://github.com/antononcube/SystemModeling/tree/master/Projects/Coronavirus-propagation-dynamics/R/COVID-19-modeling-in-R),
\[AA1\].

Approximately 30% of the presentation was based on an R-programmed software monad for epidemiology compartmental models,
[ECMMon-R](https://github.com/antononcube/ECMMon-R), 
\[AAr2\].

For the rest were used frameworks, simulations, and graphics made with
[Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica), 
\[AAr1\].

The presentation was given online (because of COVID-19) using Zoom. 
[90 people registered](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-miami/events/270611412/).
Nearly 40 showed up (and maybe 20 stayed throughout.) 

Here is a link to the [video recording]().

[A similar presentation](https://github.com/antononcube/SystemModeling/tree/master/Presentations/UseR!-Meetup-Boston-2020)
was given six weeks prior for [UseR!-Boston-Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Boston-useR/events/269304135/).
